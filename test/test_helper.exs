# Test helper for PhoenixKitHelloWorld test suite.
#
# Level 1: Unit tests (schemas, changesets, pure functions) always run.
# Level 2: Integration tests require PostgreSQL — automatically excluded
#          when the database is unavailable (`:integration` tag).
#
# To enable integration tests:
#
#     mix test.setup           # createdb + migrate
#     mix test
#
# The test endpoint runs with `server: false` (no port opened); LiveView
# tests drive it via `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.live/2` only.

# Elixir 1.19's `mix test` no longer auto-loads modules from the
# `:elixirc_paths` test directories at test-helper time — only files
# matching `:test_load_filters` get loaded by the test runner. Our
# support modules are compiled but not loaded, so explicit
# `Code.require_file/2` calls are needed before this file references
# them.
